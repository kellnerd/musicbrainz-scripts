**[Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) and [Userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for [MusicBrainz.org](https://musicbrainz.org)**

In order to use one of the **bookmarklets** you have to save the compressed code snippet from the respective section below as a bookmark. Make sure to add the bookmark to a toolbar of your browser which you can easily access while you are editing on MusicBrainz.

While bookmarklets are good for trying things out because they do not require additional software to be installed, **userscripts** are more convenient if you need a snippet frequently. In case you have installed a userscript manager browser extension you can simply install userscripts from this page by clicking the *Install* button. Another benefit of them is that you will receive automatic updates if your userscript manager is configured accordingly.
